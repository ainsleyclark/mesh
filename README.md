## Why meshCSS?

meshCSS is a pureCSS framework built on a responsive grid system, featuring an array of pure dynamic components, such as modals, tabs, alerts and many more. Better yet,
it's extremely quick - <strong>100kb minified.</strong><br />
mesh was specifically built with a modular approach, to allow you to cut back on classes and components by using our sass files or our unique meshBuilder.<br/>
In addition, mesh has a huge amount of very useful utility classes and it's built entirely around flexbox, which enables you to write HTML quicker.<br/>
Simple, concise and easy to pick up, mesh will save you time and make layouts a breeze.

## Getting Started

Head over to the [installation](https://meshcss.com/documentation/getting-started/installation) page for more details on how to download and install mesh. Here are a few options to get you started.

- **meshBuilder** - We recommend you visit the [meshBuilder](https://www.meshcss.com/builder) before downloading. With this powerful tool, you only download the components/utilities you need and you can change variables such as colors and spacing.
- **Direct download** - Download the [latest release](https://github.com/ainsleyclark/mesh/releases/latest) with pre-compiled CSS.
- **npm** - Install with [npm](https://npmjs.com) to get all source files as they are available on Github: ```npm install meshcss```.
- **CDN** - Load CSS via CDN from [jsDelivr](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ainsleyclark/mesh@master/dist/css/mesh.min.css): https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ainsleyclark/mesh@master/dist/css/mesh.min.css


## Documentation
